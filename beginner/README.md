# Champignons de Paris

## Your task

A small restaurant in London has hired you to create the landing page for their new website. They have already paid other freelancers to come up with the content and designs. Your task is to use these to implement their vision as faithfully as possible.

## Resources

You can view the end goal in `target.pdf`.

You can find the intended background image in `background.jpg`.

The fonts to be used are as follows (both from Google Fonts, already included in the project):

- Parisienne for the main heading
- Open Sans for the rest of the content

The colour palette to be used is as follows:

- `#fcf1e9` for the main background
- `#f0dfd2` for the third-level heading backgrounds
- `#e6c9b3` for the main border

## Instructions

You should add content and styles to the page until it resembles the end goal. To achieve this, the files you need to edit are `index.html` and `style.css`.
